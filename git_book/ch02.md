# Git Basics

### 1. Getting a Git Repository
* At the current directory, type the following command to initialize the directory as Git repository:
```
git init
```

* Once you add and modify files, use the following commands to make the first commit:
```
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
```

* The following command clones a Git repository from \<url\> into a Git repository named \<dir\> (If you did not specify \<dir\>, the default name from \<url\> will be used).
```
git clone <url> <dir>
```

### 2. Recording Changes to the Repository
* Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Track files are files that were in the last snapshopt (ummodified, modified, or staged). Untracked files are everything else.

* Use `git status` command to determine which files are in which state. If you have a new file that you did not stage using `git add <filename>`, it will be listed in untracked files from `git status` output.

* `git add <filename>` will track the new file, and you can check that it is listed in changes to be committed list from `git status` output. 

* Once you modify a tracked file, it will be listed under changes not staged for commit even if it was added previously. 

* `git status -s` or `git status --short` will give a more simplified output: A for staging area, M for modified files, ?? for untracked files. There are two columns to the output - the left-hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working tree.
