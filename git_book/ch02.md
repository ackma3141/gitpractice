# Git Basics

### 1. Getting a Git Repository
* At the current directory, type the following command to initialize the directory as Git repository:
```
git init
```

* Once you add and modify files, use the following commands to make the first commit:
```
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
```

* The following command clones a Git repository from <url> into a Git repository named <dir>:
```
git clone <url> <dir>
```
If you did not specify <dir>, the default name from <url> will be used.
