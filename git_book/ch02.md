# Git Basics

### 1. Getting a Git Repository
* At the current directory, type the following command to initialize the directory as Git repository:
```
git init
```

* Once you add and modify files, use the following commands to make the first commit:
```
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
```

* The following command clones a Git repository from \<url\> into a Git repository named \<dir\> (If you did not specify \<dir\>, the default name from \<url\> will be used).
```
git clone <url> <dir>
```

### 2. Recording Changes to the Repository
* Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Track files are files that were in the last snapshopt (ummodified, modified, or staged). Untrack files are everything else.
