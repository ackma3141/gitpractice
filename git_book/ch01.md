# Getting Started

### 1. About Version Control
* Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 
* The simplest VCS (verson control system) is local VCS such as RCS.

* Centralized VCS (CVCS) enables collaboration with developers. The system has a single server that contains all versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from the central place.

* Distributed VCS (DVCS) is CVSC, but unlike CVSC, DVCS enables client to fully mirror the repository from the server, including its fully history, to clients' local repository
